## **Project Description**

A movie rating Android app that uses tomatoes to rate movies. It was made in Application Development class in which we followed the Scrum Agile Framework to develop the app.

## **Technology Stack**

Since this is an Android App, we used Kotlin and Jetpack Compose to develop the app in Android Studio.

We used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAsIGrBhAAEiwAEzMlC_voBzTeUCCnNSKAj8T1_TTaMwSMOOdOvaeM8PxcgWoJx-XWLPfpxRoCjlsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) for storing the app's data and for the accounts and authorization.

We also used the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) to get the movie information for our app.

## **Application Functionality**
